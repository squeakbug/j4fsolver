# Graphs

## Labels as types, that express some properties/effects

The [NGSI-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGSI-LD) information model specified by ETSI is an attempt at formally specifying property graphs, with node and **relationship (edge) types** that may play the role of labels in previously mentioned models and support semantic referencing by inheriting classes defined in shared ontologies.
